Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This task focused on understanding the dataset through exploratory data analysis techniques using the Titanic dataset.

Steps I Followed:

1. Loaded the Dataset:
    Imported the Titanic dataset using Pandas and Numpy

2. Explored the Structure: 
    Viewed basic information using .head(), .info(), .describe() 
    Checked for missing values and data types

3. Visualized Key Columns:
    Plotted histograms, boxplots, and count plots to explore distributions
    Used correlation matrix and pair plots to understand relationships between features

4. Drew Insights:
    Identified trends (e.g., survival rates by gender/class)
    Found missing data patterns and planned data cleaning steps
